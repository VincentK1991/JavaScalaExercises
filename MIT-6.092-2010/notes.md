# Notes
These problem sets are written in Java, but I refactored them entirely to Scala. I used sbt as a build tool. The project has 7 assignments. Each assignment is contained in a project with the main method/object.

To compile and run using the command lines, enter the command `sbt` in your terminal. This will create sbt shell.
To compile the files in the project. enter the command `compile` in the sbt shell.

To run the main in a project enter `runMain project-name.Main`
