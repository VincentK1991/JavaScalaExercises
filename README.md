# Java and Scala Exercises

In these exercises, I worked on class assignments. The assignment code bases are entirely written in Java. I refactored some of these codes to Scala as part of the exercises and integrated back to the existing Java code bases.


## MIT6.005 (Spring 2016)
[Software Construction](http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/sp16/)
In this couse, I wrote scala codes integrated to existing java codes.

## MIT6.092 (IAP 2010)
[Introduction to Programming in Java](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-092-introduction-to-programming-in-java-january-iap-2010/)
In this course, I refactored all of the codes to scala.

## MIT6.092 (IAP 2006)
[Java Preparation](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-092-java-preparation-for-6-170-january-iap-2006/)
In this course, I did the assignments exclusively on Java.
