# Notes
These problem sets are written entirely in Java. I used Intellij to build the projects.

To compile and run using the command lines, go to the source files and compile files
enter the command to the terminal `javac *.java`

And to run these files, go to the project directory and enter the command
`java project/class-with-main-method`
